# viagogo test
A Python CLI program that accepts a 2d coordinate and returns a list of the 5 nearest events, along with the cheapest ticket for each of those events.

## Setup
This project uses Python 3.6, which can either be installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or a package manager.

The Windows installer comes with a `py` wrapper that should be used instead of `python` when running the program.

This program only uses the standard Python libraries - no dependencies need to be installed.
